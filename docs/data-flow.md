# Data Flow

## Overview

This document describes how requests and management operations move through ccflare today.

The major flows are:

- management/API requests
- proxied provider requests
- websocket proxy requests
- request/log event streaming
- OAuth account onboarding

## Runtime Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    CLIENT[Client]
    SERVER[runtime-server]
    API[api]
    DASH[web assets]
    PROXY[proxy]
    DB[(SQLite)]
    PROVIDERS[providers]
    WORKER[post-processor worker]

    CLIENT --> SERVER
    SERVER --> API
    SERVER --> DASH
    SERVER --> PROXY
    API --> DB
    PROXY --> PROVIDERS
    PROXY --> DB
    PROXY --> WORKER
    WORKER --> DB
```

## HTTP Management Requests

Management endpoints follow this path:

1. request arrives at the Bun server
2. `runtime-server` sends it to `APIRouter`
3. a pre-instantiated handler performs validation and database/repository work
4. the handler returns JSON or SSE via `http`

Examples:

- `/health`
- `/api/accounts`
- `/api/stats`
- `/api/analytics`
- `/api/logs/stream`
- `/api/requests`

## Proxy Request Flow

Provider-native requests follow this path:

1. request arrives at `/v1/{provider}/...`
2. runtime server routes it to the proxy layer
3. proxy resolves the provider implementation
4. proxy/session strategy selects candidate accounts
5. provider prepares upstream URL and headers
6. request is forwarded upstream
7. response metadata is normalized
8. request events and persistence work are scheduled

### Proxy Forwarding Sequence

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Runtime
    participant Proxy
    participant Strategy
    participant DB
    participant Provider
    participant Upstream

    Client->>Runtime: /v1/{provider}/...
    Runtime->>Proxy: handle proxy request
    Proxy->>Provider: resolve provider implementation
    Proxy->>Strategy: select candidate accounts
    Strategy->>DB: read account state
    DB-->>Strategy: available accounts
    Strategy-->>Proxy: ordered candidates
    Proxy->>Provider: prepare URL + headers
    Proxy->>Upstream: forward request
    Upstream-->>Proxy: response
    Proxy-->>Runtime: proxied response
    Runtime-->>Client: proxied response
```

## WebSocket Flow

Websocket-capable provider routes go through the same runtime routing layer, but switch into the websocket proxy path when the request is an upgrade request.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    REQ[Incoming /v1/{provider}/... request]
    UPGRADE{WebSocket upgrade?}
    WS[websocket proxy handler]
    HTTP[standard HTTP proxy path]
    UPSTREAM[Upstream provider]

    REQ --> UPGRADE
    UPGRADE -->|yes| WS
    UPGRADE -->|no| HTTP
    WS --> UPSTREAM
    HTTP --> UPSTREAM
```

## Response and Usage Processing

For HTTP proxy traffic:

- the proxy handles immediate forwarding concerns
- account/rate-limit state is updated
- request metadata is queued for persistence
- background post-processing extracts additional usage, payload, and summary information

For streaming and websocket traffic:

- the proxy emits chunk/summary payloads to the worker
- the worker parses provider-specific usage events
- final summaries and payloads are persisted asynchronously

## Event Streaming

ccflare exposes two real-time SSE streams:

- `/api/requests/stream`
- `/api/logs/stream`

### Event Streaming Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    INTERNAL[Internal events]
    API[api SSE handlers]
    SSE[SSE response stream]
    DASH[dashboard]
    CLIENT[external client]

    INTERNAL --> API
    API --> SSE
    SSE --> DASH
    SSE --> CLIENT
```

Request events come from the request-event bus; log events come from the log bus.

## OAuth Account Onboarding Flow

OAuth account onboarding is provider-scoped.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Client
    participant API
    participant OAuthFlow
    participant ProviderOAuth
    participant Database

    User->>Client: add OAuth account
    Client->>API: POST /api/auth/{provider}/init
    API->>OAuthFlow: begin(...)
    OAuthFlow->>ProviderOAuth: build auth URL
    OAuthFlow->>Database: create auth session
    API-->>Client: auth URL + session id

    User->>ProviderOAuth: authorize
    ProviderOAuth-->>Client: code
    Client->>API: POST /api/auth/{provider}/complete
    API->>OAuthFlow: complete(...)
    OAuthFlow->>ProviderOAuth: exchange code for tokens
    OAuthFlow->>Database: create account + update auth session
    API-->>Client: success
```

Important note:

- auth flow state is stored in `auth_sessions`
- callback forwarding is provider-scoped and managed by `api`

## Database Writes During Normal Operation

### `accounts`

Updated for:

- account creation
- token refresh
- request/session counters
- pause/resume state
- rate-limit metadata

### `requests`

Updated for:

- request metadata
- status and timing
- model selection
- token and cost analytics
- failover attempt counts

### `request_payloads`

Updated for:

- full request/response payload persistence
- debugging and request inspection

### `auth_sessions`

Updated for:

- OAuth onboarding state
- completion status transitions
- session expiry management

## Background Work

Background processing exists to keep the request path responsive.

The main mechanisms are:

- `AsyncDbWriter` for non-blocking writes
- the proxy post-processor worker for stream/websocket usage extraction

### Background Persistence Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    PROXY[proxy]
    WORKER[post-processor worker]
    WRITER[AsyncDbWriter]
    DB[(SQLite)]

    PROXY --> WRITER
    PROXY --> WORKER
    WORKER --> WRITER
    WRITER --> DB
```

This keeps forwarding latency low while preserving detailed observability.

## Design Summary

Today’s data flow is intentionally simple:

- `runtime-server` routes
- `api` manages the control plane
- `proxy` manages the data plane
- `providers` own provider-specific parsing/auth details
- `database` persists state and analytics inputs
- dashboard and TUI consume the same management surface
