# Account Routing Architecture

This document explains how better-ccflare picks an account for each proxied request: the master pipeline, the four load-balancing strategies, usage-throttling, model-scoped capacity routing, and auto-fallback. It is a technical reference for understanding *why* a given request landed on a given account — for user-facing setup guides see [Load Balancing](./load-balancing.md), [Auto-Fallback Configuration](./auto-fallback.md), [Combos](./combos.md), and [Configuration](./configuration.md).

## Overview: Three Orthogonal Axes

Account routing is controlled by three independent settings that can each be changed at runtime without restarting the server: the **load-balancing strategy** (`lb_strategy` — which of the four strategies below picks the candidate order), **usage-throttling** (`usage_throttling_five_hour_enabled` / `usage_throttling_weekly_enabled` — an optional pacing gate applied after strategy selection), and **model-scoped capacity routing** (`model_scoped_capacity_routing` — `off` or `exhausted`, an optional per-model-family exclusion filter). Any runtime "combination" you observe (e.g. `least-used` with weekly throttling and capacity routing both on) is not a special combined mode — it is simply the master pipeline below with the configured strategy plugged into the `Strategy.select` step, and the two optional gates turned on or off. Understanding the pipeline once is enough to reason about every valid combination of the three settings.

## Master Pipeline

Every proxied request first checks for the `x-better-ccflare-account-id` force-route header (used both for manual force-routing and by internal auto-refresh/keepalive probes), then runs the configured strategy's `select()`, then an optional model-capacity filter, then an optional usage-throttling gate. If the candidate pool is empty afterwards, the response depends on *why* it emptied — the capacity filter and usage-throttling empty the pool for mutually exclusive reasons on a given request (the capacity filter runs first and, if it excludes everyone, usage-throttling never sees any accounts to throttle), so the code checks them in a fixed priority order: a capacity exclusion is reported first (as a structured 429), a throttling exclusion second (as a 529), and a strategy-level "nothing available at all" last (as a generic 503). When a [Combo](./combos.md) is active for the request's model family, an additional per-slot routing layer runs between the forced-header check and `Strategy.select`; it is omitted from the diagram below for clarity (see `packages/proxy/src/handlers/account-selector.ts`).

## The Four Load-Balancing Strategies

`lb_strategy` selects one of four implementations (`packages/load-balancer/src/strategies/`), all constructed in `apps/server/src/server.ts`. All four return an ordered list of candidate accounts; the first entry is tried first, the rest are failover order.

### session (SessionStrategy)

The default strategy pins a client to one account for the configured session duration (5h by default) so prompt caches stay warm, and only rotates to a new account once that session expires, the account becomes unavailable, or a higher-priority account frees up. Unlike the drain-soonest variant below, an active session *can* be preempted — but only by a strictly higher-priority account, never by a same-or-lower-priority one. Auto-fallback candidates are checked first on every call; if one becomes eligible, its session is reset but it is not force-ranked to the top — it is simply included in a fresh priority-sorted list, avoiding a priority inversion if an even-higher-priority account is already available.

```mermaid

    I --> J["Start a new session on the winner,<br/>return it first"]
```

### session-drain-soonest (SessionDrainSoonestStrategy)

This strategy shares session-affinity and auto-fallback semantics with `session`, but replaces the static-priority tiebreak with a "use it or lose it" ranking: at every fresh selection it prefers whichever account's `weekly_all` usage window resets *soonest*, so unused weekly capacity is drained before it is replaced by a fresh, unrelated allowance. The one deliberate exception is its whole purpose — an active session is **never** preempted by drain ranking, only by auto-fallback reactivation, which is force-ranked to position 0 (unlike `session`, which never forces a position).

    A["select(accounts, meta)"] --> B["Find auto-fallback candidates<br/>(identical rule to session strategy)"]

    C -->|"None found"| E{"Active session on some account,<br/>and it is still available?"}
    E -->|"Yes"| F["NEVER preempted —<br/>continue this session regardless of<br/>any other account's drain ranking"]
    E -->|"No / unavailable"| G["Rank available accounts:<br/>earliest future weekly_all reset ASC<br/>(unknown or past reset sorts last),<br/>then priority ASC, then utilization ASC"]
    G --> H["Start a new session on the winner,<br/>return it first"]
```

### session-affinity (SessionAffinityStrategy)

A hybrid of `session` and `least-used`, keyed on the *client's* session id (the request body's `metadata.user_id`) rather than a single account-level session: the first request from a new client is routed to the least-loaded account, and that client→account mapping then stays sticky for `affinityTtlMs`. This spreads many concurrent client-sessions across the whole pool (instead of `session`'s single account taking all traffic until it rate-limits), while each individual client still keeps its prompt-cache locality. A request with no `clientSessionId` at all is still routed to the least-used account, but since there is no client id to key on, no sticky mapping is recorded for it — the next such request is scored fresh. Auto-fallback here only auto-*unpauses* eligible accounts so they re-enter the pool — it never forces a pick, unlike `session`/`session-drain-soonest`.

```mermaid

    A["select(accounts, meta)"] --> B["Auto-unpause eligible accounts<br/>(auto_fallback_enabled + safe pause<br/>reason + window elapsed) — no forced<br/>ordering, just re-enters the pool"]

    C2 -->|"Yes, but mapped account<br/>is unavailable"| E["Temporary failover to the<br/>least-used available account —<br/>mapping is NOT deleted, snaps back<br/>once the original recovers"]
    C2 -->|"No mapping / expired"| F["Assign the least-used<br/>available account, make it<br/>sticky for affinityTtlMs"]

    D --> H["Return chosen account<br/>plus ranked fallbacks"]
    E --> H
    G --> H
```

### least-used (LeastUsedStrategy)

The simplest strategy: no session stickiness at all, every request independently picks the account with the lowest effective utilization (upstream utilization plus a short recency penalty so concurrent bursts spread across the pool instead of piling onto the same "emptiest" account). It trades prompt-cache reuse for better burst tolerance — a spike of N concurrent requests is spread across all healthy accounts rather than funneled into one, reducing the chance of several accounts hitting per-account rate limits at once. Like `session-affinity`, its auto-fallback handling only auto-unpauses eligible accounts; it never forces a pick.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["select(accounts, meta)"] --> B["Auto-unpause eligible accounts<br/>(auto_fallback_enabled + safe pause<br/>reason + window elapsed) — no forced<br/>ordering, just re-enters the pool"]

    C --> D["Pick the lowest-scored account,<br/>mark it recently-picked<br/>(a concurrent pick within 500ms is<br/>penalized — approximates round-robin<br/>under bursts)"]
    D --> E["Return the sorted list,<br/>winner first"]
```

## Usage Throttling

Independent of which strategy picked the candidate order, usage-throttling (`usage_throttling_five_hour_enabled` / `usage_throttling_weekly_enabled`) can hold an account back even though it isn't rate-limited yet. For each enabled window class, ccflare computes its own linear **pacing line** — the percentage of the window's duration that has elapsed — and compares it against Anthropic's real reported utilization: if the account is "ahead of pace" it is throttled until the point where reported usage and the pacing line would realign. A per-model weekly cap only counts against the request's own model family for normal requests — but combo-routed requests assign their per-slot model later in the pipeline, so `applyUsageThrottling` passes no request model for them and model-scoped weekly windows are skipped entirely (only the flat, non-scoped windows and the reactive `out_of_credits` cache still apply). Internal auto-refresh/keepalive probes (identified by the `x-better-ccflare-auto-refresh` / `x-better-ccflare-keepalive` request headers) are exempted from this gate entirely — they exist specifically to hit the real endpoint and observe state changes (window resets, recovered accounts), and without the exemption a throttled-but-healthy account's own probe would get our own 529 back, which the auto-refresh scheduler previously misread as an endpoint failure and counted toward its consecutive-failure pause threshold.

```

## Model-Capacity Routing

When `model_scoped_capacity_routing` is set to `exhausted`, accounts whose weekly per-model-family cap (e.g. a Fable/Opus/Sonnet-specific quota) is provably exhausted are excluded from routing for requests of that family — in both normal and combo-slot routing. Exclusion has two independent signals: a **telemetry-confirmed** one (the account's own usage payload shows every relevant weekly-scoped row at ≥100% with a future reset, and pay-as-you-go overage is confirmed unavailable) and a **reactive** one (a recently observed `out_of_credits` 429 sidelines the account for that family for a short, fixed TTL to bridge the telemetry poll interval). The filter fails open on any ambiguity — an unknown model family, missing/dropped telemetry rows, or an unresolved overage signal never causes an exclusion — because a false exclusion removes a working account while a false pass only costs one extra 429 round-trip. Only when excluding accounts empties an otherwise non-empty candidate pool does the request get the structured `model_family_exhausted` response instead of falling through to the generic pool-exhausted path.

    C --> D{"Telemetry: EVERY weekly_scoped row<br/>for this family is >= 100% with a<br/>future reset, AND overage is<br/>CONFIRMED unavailable?"}

## Auto-Fallback

The same per-account `auto_fallback_enabled` flag drives two different mechanisms depending on which strategy is active, and the two mechanisms do **not** share one eligibility rule — they diverge on exactly which state an account must be in. `session` and `session-drain-soonest` run a dedicated `checkForAutoFallbackAccounts` pass: it filters candidates on provider window-reset support (Anthropic, Codex, or Zai) with `rate_limit_reset` passed AND not currently rate-limited by ccflare — deliberately checking paused status nowhere, so both paused and already-unpaused accounts can win this pass — then walks the survivors in priority order and unpauses the first one whose `pause_reason` is safe (`null`, `overage`, or `rate_limit_window` — never `manual` or `failure_threshold`), letting it float up in a fresh priority sort (`session`) or forcing it to the very front, even preempting an active session (`session-drain-soonest`). `least-used` and `session-affinity` instead only auto-*unpause* eligible accounts via the shared `wouldAutoUnpause` predicate, which requires `account.paused === true` (unlike the other pass, an already-unpaused account is simply skipped here — there's nothing to unpause) plus the same provider/window-reset/safe-pause-reason checks, but does **not** check `rate_limited_until` at all; the account re-enters the normal pool but must still win that strategy's own ranking (utilization score or sticky affinity) to actually be chosen, and neither strategy force-picks it.
