## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Bun** >= 1.2.8 (required): Install from [bun.sh](https://bun.sh)
- **Git**: For version control
- **SQLite**: Comes bundled with Bun, no separate installation needed

**Note**: Node.js is not required as the project uses Bun exclusively.

### Cloning and Installing

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub

2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/better-ccflare.git
   cd better-ccflare
   ```

3. **Add the upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/better-ccflare.git
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

5. **Build the dashboard and CLI** (required before first run):
   ```bash
   bun run build
   ```

   **Important**: You must run this build step at least once before starting the server. The `bun run build` command builds the web dashboard and CLI components. Without this step, the dashboard files won't be available when you start the server.

6. **Verify the installation**:
   ```bash
   # Run type checking
   bun run typecheck

   # Run linting
   bun run lint

   # Run formatting
   bun run format
   ```

### Environment Variables (Optional)

The following environment variables can be used during development:

- `LB_STRATEGY` - Override the default load balancing strategy
- `CLIENT_ID` - Set a custom OAuth client ID
- `RETRY_ATTEMPTS` - Number of retry attempts for failed requests
- `RETRY_DELAY_MS` - Delay between retry attempts in milliseconds

**Note**: Most configuration is handled through the config file and CLI. Environment variables are optional overrides.

### Running the Development Environment

**First time setup**: Make sure you've run `bun run build` at least once (see step 5 above).

```bash
# Start the server in development mode with hot reload
bun run dev:server

# In another terminal, start the CLI
bun run dev:cli

# Or start the CLI interface
bun run cli

# Or work on the dashboard (rebuilds on changes)
bun run dev:dashboard
```

**Note**: If you're making changes to the dashboard, use `bun run dev:dashboard` for hot reloading. For other changes, you may need to run `bun run build:dashboard` or `bun run build:cli` to see your changes reflected.

### Running Tests

**Note**: The project is currently in the process of setting up a comprehensive test suite. Test infrastructure is not yet implemented.

When implemented, tests will use Bun's built-in test runner:

```bash
# Run all tests
bun test

# Run tests in watch mode
bun test --watch

# Run tests for a specific package
bun test packages/core
```

### Important Post-Change Commands

After making any code changes, always run these commands before committing:

```bash
# Fix linting issues
bun run lint

# Check for type errors
bun run typecheck

# Format code
bun run format
```

### CLAUDE.md File

The project includes a `CLAUDE.md` file in the root directory that provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with the codebase. This file contains:
- Project overview and purpose
- Important commands to run after making changes
- Development and maintenance commands
- Project-specific guidelines

When contributing, ensure any major architectural changes or new patterns are documented in CLAUDE.md to help future AI-assisted development.

## Project Structure

better-ccflare is organized as a Bun monorepo with clear separation of concerns:

```
better-ccflare/
├── apps/                    # Deployable applications
│   ├── cli/                # Command-line interface

└── tsconfig.json         # TypeScript configuration
```

### Key Directories

- **`apps/`**: Contains all deployable applications. Each app has its own `package.json` and can be built independently.
- **`packages/`**: Shared code that multiple apps depend on. These are internal packages linked via Bun workspaces.
- **`docs/`**: Project documentation including architecture, data flow, and this contributing guide.

### Package Naming Convention

- Apps: Simple names (e.g., `server`, `cli`, `lander`)
- Packages: Prefixed with `@better-ccflare/` (e.g., `@better-ccflare/core`, `@better-ccflare/database`)

## Coding Standards

We use Biome for both linting and formatting to maintain consistent code quality across the project.

### TypeScript Style Guide

1. **Type Safety**
   - Always use explicit types for function parameters and return values
   - Avoid using `any` - use `unknown` if the type is truly unknown
   - Prefer interfaces over type aliases for object shapes
   - Use const assertions for literal types

   ```typescript
   // Good
   interface Account {
     id: string;
     name: string;
     priority: number;
   }
   
   function getAccount(id: string): Account | null {
     // ...
   }
   
   // Bad
   function getAccount(id: any) {
     // ...
   }
   ```

2. **Async/Await**
   - Always use async/await instead of promises
   - Handle errors with try/catch blocks
   - Use Promise.all for concurrent operations

   ```typescript
   // Good
   async function fetchData() {
     try {
       const [accounts, requests] = await Promise.all([
         getAccounts(),
         getRequests()
       ]);
       return { accounts, requests };
     } catch (error) {
       logger.error('Failed to fetch data', error);
       throw error;
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Error Handling**
   - Create custom error classes for domain-specific errors
   - Always include context in error messages
   - Use error boundaries in React components

4. **Naming Conventions**
   - Use camelCase for variables and functions
   - Use PascalCase for types, interfaces, and classes
   - Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
   - Prefix boolean variables with `is`, `has`, or `should`

   ```typescript
   const MAX_RETRIES = 3;
   const isRateLimited = true;
   
   interface AccountStatus {
     hasValidToken: boolean;
     isActive: boolean;
   }
   ```

### Biome Linting Rules

Our Biome configuration enforces:

- Tab indentation (not spaces)
- Double quotes for strings
- Organized imports (automatic with `organizeImports: "on"`)
- All recommended Biome rules
- Consistent code formatting

Run linting and auto-fix issues with:
```bash
bun run lint
```

**Note**: The lint command includes `--write --unsafe` flags which will automatically fix issues where possible.

### Import Conventions

1. **Import Order** (automatically organized by Biome):
   - External packages
   - Internal packages (`@better-ccflare/*`)
   - Relative imports
   - Type imports

2. **Path Aliases**:
   - Use package imports for cross-package dependencies
   - Use relative imports within the same package
   - Avoid circular dependencies

   ```typescript
   // Good
   import { Database } from '@better-ccflare/database';
   import { LoadBalancer } from '@better-ccflare/load-balancer';
   import { formatDate } from './utils';
   import type { Account } from '@better-ccflare/types';
   
   // Bad
   import { Database } from '../../../packages/database/src';
   ```

## Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for our commit messages.

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that don't affect code meaning (formatting)
- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **build**: Changes to build system or dependencies
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration
- **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files

### Scope

The scope should be the package or app name:
- `server`, `cli`, `lander`
- `core`, `database`, `proxy`, `load-balancer`, etc.

### Examples

```bash
feat(load-balancer): improve session persistence

Enhances the session-based strategy to better handle failover scenarios
while maintaining session affinity. This reduces rate limit occurrences
and improves overall reliability.

Closes #123

---

fix(proxy): handle token refresh race condition

Multiple concurrent requests were causing token refresh stampedes.
Added mutex to ensure only one refresh happens at a time.

---

docs(contributing): add testing guidelines section

---

refactor(database): extract migration logic to separate module

This improves testability and makes the migration system more modular.

BREAKING CHANGE: Database.migrate() method signature has changed
```

## Testing Guidelines

**Current Status**: Test infrastructure is not yet implemented. This section describes the planned testing approach.

### Future Test Structure

Tests will be co-located with the code they test:

```
packages/core/
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts
│   ├── index.test.ts
│   ├── utils.ts
│   └── utils.test.ts
└── package.json
```

### Writing Tests (Future Implementation)

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual functions and classes
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Aim for high code coverage
   - Use descriptive test names

   ```typescript
   import { describe, it, expect, mock } from 'bun:test';
   import { calculateAccountWeight } from './utils';
   
   describe('calculateAccountPriority', () => {
     it('should return priority 0 for primary accounts', () => {
       const account = { priority: 0, name: 'primary-account' };
       expect(calculateAccountPriority(account)).toBe(0);
     });

     it('should return priority 50 for medium priority accounts', () => {
       const account = { priority: 50, name: 'medium-priority-account' };
       expect(calculateAccountPriority(account)).toBe(50);
     });
   });
   ```

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test interactions between modules
   - Use real database for database tests
   - Test API endpoints end-to-end

3. **E2E Tests** (when implemented)
   - Test complete user workflows
   - Use real browser for dashboard tests
   - Test CLI commands

### Test Best Practices

- Write tests before fixing bugs (regression tests)
- Keep tests focused and independent
- Use meaningful assertions
- Clean up test data after tests
- Use test fixtures for complex data

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation

1. **JSDoc Comments**
   - Document all public APIs
   - Include parameter descriptions
   - Add usage examples

   ```typescript
   /**
    * Selects the best account for handling a request based on the configured strategy.
    * 
    * @param accounts - List of available accounts
    * @param strategy - Load balancing strategy to use
    * @returns The selected account or null if no accounts are available
    * 
    * @example
    * const account = selectAccount(accounts, 'session');
    * if (account) {
    *   await forwardRequest(account, request);
    * }
    */
   export function selectAccount(
     accounts: Account[], 
     strategy: LoadBalancingStrategy
   ): Account | null {
     // ...
   }
   ```

2. **README Files**
   - Each package should have a README
   - Include installation, usage, and API docs

## Common Development Tasks

### Working with the CLI

The CLI functionality provides explicit commands for all operations. Use `bun run cli` with command-line flags:

```bash
# If better-ccflare is not installed globally, use:
# bun run cli [options]
# or build and run with: bun run better-ccflare

# Add a new account
bun run cli --add-account <name> --mode <max|console|zai|openai-compatible> --priority <number>

# List all accounts
bun run cli --list

# Remove an account
bun run cli --remove <name>

# Pause/resume accounts
bun run cli --pause <name>
bun run cli --resume <name>

# Reset usage statistics
bun run cli --reset-stats

# Clear request history
bun run cli --clear-history

# View statistics (JSON output)
bun run cli --stats

# Stream logs
bun run cli --logs [N]  # Show N lines of history then follow

# Analyze database performance
bun run cli --analyze

# Start server with dashboard
bun run cli --serve --port 8080
# or simply:
bun start

# Show help
bun run cli --help
```

### Running the Server

```bash
# Start the production server (port 8080)
bun run server
# or
bun run start
# or
bun start

# Start the server with hot reload
bun run dev:server
```

### Working with the Dashboard

```bash
# Build the dashboard
bun run build:dashboard

# Run dashboard in development mode
bun run dev:dashboard
```

### Working with the CLI

```bash
# Run the CLI application
bun run cli
# or (builds first, then runs)
bun run better-ccflare

# Build the CLI
bun run build:cli
```

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build all applications
bun run build

# Build specific applications
bun run build:dashboard
bun run build:cli
bun run build:lander
```

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **TypeScript errors**: Run `bun run typecheck` to identify issues
2. **Formatting issues**: Run `bun run format` to auto-fix
3. **Import errors**: Ensure you're using workspace imports (`@better-ccflare/*`) for cross-package dependencies
4. **Database issues**: The SQLite database is created automatically in the data directory
