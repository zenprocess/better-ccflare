/**
 * Compact SQLite database (checkpoint + vacuum + WAL truncate).
 *
 * REFUSES if another process holds the writer lock — typically the running
 * better-ccflare server. Running compact concurrently with a live server
 * stalls every main-thread DB write in the server (rate-limit updates,
 * OAuth refresh, post-processor inserts) on SQLite's busy_timeout, which on
 * a multi-GB DB freezes the proxy for the entire VACUUM. See the design
 * note in `packages/database/src/database-operations.ts::incrementalVacuum`
 * for the full locking rationale.
 *
 * The probe opens a short-lived second handle and tries `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`
 * with a 1 s busy_timeout. If it can claim the writer slot the lock is
 * free and we proceed with the real compact; if not, we throw a clear
 * error pointing the operator at the right next step.
 *
 * **TOCTOU caveat** (Greptile #230): the probe immediately releases the
 * writer slot before `dbOps.compact()` re-acquires it. In the millisecond
 * window between `ROLLBACK` and the worker-thread `BEGIN`, another process
 * could claim the slot — typically a service that was restarting during
 * the probe. The worker-thread compact then falls back to its own
 * busy_timeout (10 s by default), so this manifests as a short stall in
 * the CLI rather than the multi-minute hang the guard is meant to prevent.
 * For maintenance against an auto-restarting service, verify with
 * `systemctl is-active better-ccflare` (should report `inactive` or
 * `failed`) before invoking this command. A fully race-free guarantee
 * would require holding a write transaction across the entire compact
 * call, which `VACUUM` itself disallows.
