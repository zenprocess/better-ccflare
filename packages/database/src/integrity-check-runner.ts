 * blob URL when the compiled worker is embedded, file URL when running
 * source-mode from a checkout).
 *
 * The worker opens its own `bun:sqlite` handle — required because
 * `bun:sqlite` is synchronous and even `PRAGMA quick_check` on a multi-GB
 * DB blocks the JS event loop for tens of seconds. We don't want the
 * proxy stalled during that window — at ~30 s of frozen event loop,
 * downstream sockets get reset by the OS and clients see "socket
 * connection was closed unexpectedly". Both `quick` and `full` route
 * through the worker.
 *
 * Race the worker promise against a configurable timeout (default 10 min,
 * env override `CCFLARE_INTEGRITY_CHECK_WORKER_TIMEOUT_MS`). On timeout the
 * worker is terminated and the runner returns
 * `{ ok: false, error: "worker timed out" }` — callers translate that to a
 * `corrupt` result, which releases the scheduler mutex and keeps the next
 * tick eligible to run. Without this cap a stuck I/O syscall in the worker
 * would freeze integrity checking for the entire process lifetime
 * (potentially weeks between restarts).
