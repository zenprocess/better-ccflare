/**
 * Verifies that `configureSqlite()` issues `PRAGMA mmap_size = 0` when the
 * config requests it.
 *
 * Background: before this fix the PRAGMA was gated on `mmapSize > 0`, so the
 * default `mmapSize: 0` silently fell through to bun:sqlite's built-in mmap
 * default (a large value). On a 15 GiB database that's the entire file
 * memory-mapped, which stays invisible until something walks every page
 * (full-DB VACUUM, large scan) and the resident set blows past the cgroup
 * MemoryHigh / MemoryMax limits. The fix flips the guard to "issue the PRAGMA
 * whenever the operator has specified a value, including 0".
 *
 * The mmap state isn't directly observable through bun:sqlite, but
 * `PRAGMA mmap_size` query returns the current configured limit on the
 * connection — that's what we assert against.
