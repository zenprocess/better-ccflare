/**
 * Tests for AsyncDbWriter:
 *  - Backward-compatible enqueue() path (metadata queue)
 *  - New enqueuePayload() path (payload queue with byte + count caps)
 *  - Drain loop budget (MAX_JOBS_PER_TICK, MAX_DRAIN_MS_PER_TICK)
 *  - Round-robin starvation prevention (METADATA_PER_PAYLOAD = 100)
 *  - Payload-bytes accounting on success AND error paths
 *  - canAcceptPayload() admission probe
 *  - Watchdog tolerance for slow jobs
 *  - dispose() flushing both queues
 *
 * The implementation is in packages/database/src/async-writer.ts. These tests
 * exercise it without a real database — the "job" is just a callback.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: AsyncDbWriter.dispose() waits for both queues to empty by calling
 * processQueue() in a loop. If any in-flight job never resolves, dispose() will
 * hang. Tests that need to keep the queue full to observe drop behaviour use a
 * "gate" pattern: jobs await a manually-controlled promise that the test
 * releases before dispose() runs.
