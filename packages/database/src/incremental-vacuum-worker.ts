/**
 * Dedicated worker for `PRAGMA incremental_vacuum(N)`.
 *
 * Why a worker, not the main `sqliteDb` handle:
 *   `bun:sqlite` is synchronous (blocks the JS event loop for the duration of
 *   any call). `PRAGMA incremental_vacuum(N)` is a write transaction that
 *   moves up to N free pages back to the OS. For our hourly hourly retention
 *   tick (N≈8000, ~32 MiB) the operation is usually fast on local SSD, but
 *   under load or on a fragmented file it can climb into hundreds of
 *   milliseconds. Off-thread keeps the proxy's HTTP loop responsive.
 *
 * Locking: this still takes SQLite's single writer slot, so any concurrent
 * write from main or post-processor connections will wait on `busy_timeout`
 * until this finishes. That's expected and bounded by the chunk size we pass
 * in (small N → short hold).
 *
 * Memory knobs applied inside the worker connection:
 *  - `cache_size = -2000` (2 MiB): keep SQLite's page cache small; the worker
 *    is short-lived and doesn't need a big cache for one PRAGMA.
 *  - `temp_store = FILE`: never spill temp tables to RAM under cgroup pressure.
 *  - `mmap_size = 0`: no mmap; reads go through the page cache (still
 *    reclaimable by the kernel under MemoryHigh pressure).
 *  - `busy_timeout = 200`: small wait to absorb a brief write burst from the
 *    post-processor flushing a batched insert. Long enough to cover the
 *    common case (sub-100 ms commits), short enough that the worker can't
 *    extend the writer-slot hold meaningfully. Bumped from 0 after Greptile
 *    flagged that a zero timeout would silently skip every tick during
 *    sustained write activity — see the consecutive-skip counter in
 *    `incrementalVacuum()` for the escalation path. (Greptile #230)
 *
 * Refuses if `auto_vacuum != 2` — the operation is a no-op there and would
 * mask a misconfigured DB. Callers should have gated already via the same
 * check on the main connection, but the worker double-checks since it
 * opens its own handle.
